# ROB 535 Final Project - Team 25
Collaborators: Atishay Singh, Cameron Kabacinski, Adarsh Karnati, Michael Rakowiecki, Michael Fanelli, Nikhil Shetty

This repository contains the code for the Perceptron portion of the final project for ROB 535. Instructions for running the code are as follows:
Retraining the model: Run cells 1-5, in order
Testing our submitted model: Run cells 1-3, 6, in order
Cells 7-9 contain preprocessing scripts that we used to resize our dataset. If you have access to our Shared Drive, you do not need to run these scripts again.
