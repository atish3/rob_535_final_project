# ROB 535 Final Project - Team 25
Collaborators: Atishay Singh, Cameron Kabacinski, Adarsh Karnati, Michael Rakowiecki, Michael Fanelli, Nikhil Shetty

This repository contains the code for the Perceptron portion of the final project for ROB 535. Our model is based off of the VGG-16 model, with some modifications made to reduce overfitting on the majority class within our dataset. These changes are described in more detail within our report. Our model and preprocessed dataset are contained on Google Drive, and our code has been implemented and tested on Google Colab, using the availabale GPU resources. The Shared Drive link below contains our dataset, the code in this repository, and a copy of the model used to generate our final submission.

Instructions for running the code are as follows:
Retraining the model: Run cells 1-5, in order
Testing our submitted model: Run cells 1-3, 6, in order
Cells 7-9 contain preprocessing scripts that we used to resize our dataset. If you have access to our Shared Drive, you do not need to run these scripts again.
